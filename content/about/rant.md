I'm a simple guy that likes to get hands on new tech. I really like to be changelled and learn from others. That's what I'm looking in a new job.

In know that people try directly and indirectly get to the tech industry because of money. I know that I’m on other side of that. *Of course money is important as well but I feel that the love, I and Others have for coding, experiment, creating and to learn from tools or people (I like the idea of mentor) isn’t appreciated when on CV reads 3 years of something all that mater is that time*. I believe that is unfair for the candidate, I swear by it, that love and passion for your line of employment is almost like 2 x Years of experience.
